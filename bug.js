The following code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error in Firebase when using transactions with multiple updates within a single transaction.  It fails silently, leaving data inconsistent. The issue arises from not properly handling potential errors within the transaction callback function.  If one of the updates fails, the entire transaction should be rolled back, but this example neglects that crucial error handling.
